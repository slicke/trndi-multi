  Build metadata for the update check.

  The same constants as the vendored Trndi's units/misc/buildinfo.pp, but
  this program's own: a release comparison is made against trndi-multi's
  build number, not Trndi's. The values here are the local-development
  defaults; CI overwrites the file (.github/actions/write-buildinfo) with
  the build-<N> number the release will be tagged with, or PR-<n> for a
  pull request.
