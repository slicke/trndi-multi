  trndi-multi: every Trndi account in one window.

  A companion to the Trndi desktop app for households and caregivers who
  follow more than one person: each multi-user account Trndi has been set up
  with gets a tile, coloured by range, with the value, trend, delta and a
  sparkline of the last hours. Accounts and backends are configured in
  Trndi; this program only reads its settings.
